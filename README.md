# AmazingDuperBot

## What is this?
This is a bot I made to work on my Javascript and Node skills. Currently the functionality is minimal, but I plan to have a multi-functional entertainment bot by the end.

## What can it do right now?
I'll just leave the help page
<ol>
  <li> Cowsay --- &cowsay [words with spaces] --- The one and only GNUow </li>
  <li> Help   --- &help --- Will print this list </li>
  <li> Ping   --- &ping --- Will give delay between response </li>
  <li> Play/P --- &p &play --- Will play a youtube link </li>
  <li> Queue/Q--- &q &queue --- Will show the queue of songs </li>
  <li> Stop   --- &stop --- Will stop playing music and leave channel </li>
</ol>

## What are your plans?

### What content to expect
I'm hoping to have a sort of game functionality with the bot, such as pokecord or Dank Memer, as I have a test server for projects like this. I'll likely flesh this readme out if I choose to do such a thing.
I'm also looking to add the ability to stream from more than just YouTube (soundcloud, .mp3 stream, .mp4 stream, etc.)

### When will it be done
I hope to have fully added video playing from youtube and raw .mp4 streams by the end of December.

The whole project will likely be done once I run out of time or energy and the commits reach 0 a year.
